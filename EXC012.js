//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ["Awais", "Majid", "Asjad", "Farooq", "Sami", "Rehman"];
console.log(names[0], "are you invited in HAssan's Birthday Party");
console.log(names[1], "are you invited in HAssan's Birthday Party");
console.log(names[2], "are you invited in HAssan's Birthday Party");
console.log(names[3], "are you invited in HAssan's Birthday Party");
console.log(names[4], "are you invited in HAssan's Birthday Party");
