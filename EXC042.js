// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

var magicians = ["Harry Houdini", "David Blaine", "Teller", "Penn Jillette", "David Copperfield"];

function show_magicians(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        console.log(magicians[i]);
    }
}

function make_great(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = "the Great " + magicians[i];
    }
}

make_great(magicians);
show_magicians(magicians);
